# Analysis Features

The TodoList Analyzer includes powerful analysis tools to help you understand and improve your productivity. This document explains the available analysis features and how to use them effectively.

## Overview Dashboard

The main analysis dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of your task management patterns:

- **Completion Rate**: Visual representation of completed vs. pending tasks
- **Task Distribution**: Breakdown of tasks by category and priority
- **Due Date Performance**: Analysis of on-time completions vs. overdue tasks
- **Time Trends**: Charts showing task creation and completion patterns over time

## Task Completion Analysis

Understand your task completion patterns:

- **Completion by Category**: Which categories have the highest/lowest completion rates
- **Completion by Priority**: How priority levels affect completion rates
- **Time to Completion**: Average time between task creation and completion
- **Completion Streaks**: Track consecutive days with completed tasks

## Productivity Insights

Get actionable insights to improve your productivity:

- **Peak Productivity Times**: Identify times of day when you complete the most tasks
- **Task Complexity Analysis**: Relationship between estimated effort and actual time spent
- **Category Efficiency**: Which types of tasks you complete most efficiently
- **Blockers Identification**: Common patterns in delayed or incomplete tasks

## Using the Analysis Tools

### Filtering Data

Refine your analysis by filtering the data:

1. **Date Range**: Analyze tasks within specific time periods
2. **Categories**: Focus on particular categories of tasks
3. **Priority Levels**: Filter by task importance
4. **Completion Status**: Include/exclude completed or pending tasks

### Customizing Charts

Personalize the visualization of your data:

1. Click the settings icon (⚙️) on any chart
2. Select chart type (bar, line, pie, etc.)
3. Choose color schemes
4. Set data grouping options (daily, weekly, monthly)
5. Toggle data labels and legends

### Exporting Reports

Share or save your analysis:

1. Navigate to the report you want to export
2. Click the "Export" button
3. Choose format (PDF, CSV, PNG)
4. Add optional notes or annotations
5. Download or share directly

## Interpreting Results

### Key Metrics Explained

- **Task Velocity**: Number of tasks completed per day/week
- **Completion Ratio**: Percentage of created tasks that get completed
- **Focus Factor**: Time spent on high-priority vs. low-priority tasks
- **Context Switching**: Frequency of moving between different task categories

### Actionable Insights

The system automatically generates insights based on your data:

- **Suggested Task Grouping**: Recommendations for batching similar tasks
- **Optimal Scheduling**: Best times to schedule certain task types
- **Priority Adjustment**: Suggestions for re-prioritizing tasks
- **Workload Balancing**: Ways to distribute tasks more evenly

## Advanced Analysis

### Custom Queries

Create your own analysis perspectives:

1. Go to "Advanced Analysis" in the sidebar
2. Use the query builder to select dimensions and metrics
3. Apply filters and transformations
4. Save custom views for future reference

### Correlation Analysis

Discover relationships between different aspects of your tasks:

- Category vs. completion time
- Priority vs. delay patterns
- Due date proximity vs. completion probability
- Time of day vs. task completion rate

## Integration with Task Management

Your analysis directly informs task management:

- Click on any chart segment to see the underlying tasks
- Apply recommended actions directly from insight cards
- Set up automated rules based on analysis patterns
- Receive notifications about emerging productivity trends

## Technical Implementation

For developers extending the analysis features:

- Charts are implemented using Chart.js
- Data processing uses RxJS transformations
- Analysis state is managed in the NgRx store
- Custom metrics can be added in the `src/app/services/analysis.service.ts` file
