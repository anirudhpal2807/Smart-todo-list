## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Keep JavaScript clean and well-commented
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Follow modern ES6+ conventions
- Separate concerns (DOM manipulation, data handling, event listeners)
- Prefer const/let over var
- Use functions to organize code logically

### HTML/CSS Structure

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Maintain consistent class naming (we follow a functional approach)
- Make all features responsive for different screen sizes
- Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- Keep CSS organized and grouped by component/functionality

### Testing

All code contributions should be tested:

- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile device testing
- Test all features after your changes
- Verify that charts and visualizations render correctly

### Documentation

Update documentation alongside code changes:

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update code comments for developer-facing changes
- Document functions and complex logic

### Commit Messages

Write descriptive commit messages:

```

- Implement monthly calendar grid
- Add task count badges for each day
- Create month navigation controls
```
